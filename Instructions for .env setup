## Creating the `.env` File
If you don't already have a `.env` file at the root of your project, create one. This file should not be committed to your version control system.

## Adding Test Credentials
In your `.env` file, add the following lines:
```
TEST_EMAIL=your_test_account_email@example.com
TEST_PASSWORD=your_test_account_password
```
Replace `your_test_account_email@example.com` and `your_test_account_password` with the credentials of the test account you wish to use for running automated tests.

## Example `.env` Content
```
TEST_EMAIL=test@example.com
TEST_PASSWORD=securepassword123
